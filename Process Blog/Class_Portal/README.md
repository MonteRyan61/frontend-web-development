# Class Portal, Process
## Milestone 1

The overall them my portal will have is an outdoor theme. This theme will really allow me to put my personality and hobbis into the portal. With the wide range of availability that comes from an outdoors them I will be able to keep the portal professional and simplistic. The portal will be straight to the point and not have a straight forward lay out in which the user will be able to easily and efficiently navigate the menu and pages. 

I began by creating a visual mock up in the form of a sketch in order to get the layout down visualy. I realized I wanted to keep this page inviting while also testing my skills alittle so as shown below I chose to make menus base on some circular objects. 




In regard to responsiveness I plan to make use of the CSS media queries in order to change the page layout dynamically depending on the size of the window or the target device. I also will be first developing a design for mobile first as recommended in lecture to ensure that would be responsive as it is easier to adjust to having to much room rather than to little.
