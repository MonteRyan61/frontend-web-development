# Project 1, Process
## Milestone 1 Proposal

I am the current president of Theta Tau a co-ed professional engineering fraternity on campus. During out chapters we have been talking about updating our pre-existing website that was created many years back using square space. But with this project I would like to completely create a new website for our chapter in order to help spread the word and share information about what we do. The topic of my website will be surroundning the Theta Tau Fraternity, our previous events, upcoming events and contact information. My inspiration for this is to utilize and engineering skill as we are an engineering fraternity I have never liked the fact that our website was created from square space. This is something I am very passionate about and want to make very intriguing to help members have a site to look back on some cool events and get excited about future events. The intended audience for this project is the members and anyone within the engineering school.

## Wireframe

## Use of Javascript
Since this site will be mainly to show off photos, upcoming events and some history. I plan to use javascript to show that as a professional engineering fraternity we are able to apply that in many different ways including our official website. I also plan to utilize javascript to enchance page transitions through a library called transition.js. This will go past the level that CSS is able to with some over the top visuals. I also plan to utilize the google charts to show some of the stats we have on both a national and chapter level as far as members, alumni, and alumni connections across the world. I want to pursue this as it will help me in the future since visualizing data is a great tool to have and google products are supported within many company projects. One specific feature I plan to include is that when you hover over an image it will tell you what event that picture is from. This will provide more meaning behind each image.

To achieve this I plan to utilize https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs to learn more about google charts and how to implement that in my website. http://www.transitionjs.org will support my use in creating interesting transitions. I will also draw some ideas from other chapters websites to know what content must be on there. https://www.thetatauumd.com & https://www.thetataugw.org.

## Dynamic Sizing
Similar to my class project I plan to develop on a mobile size screen as if it fits well there it will be easy to adjust for the larger screen. I will also use flex boxes to keep the material in a good state when shrinking and enlarging the window size. I will put a max-width in a percentage on images to prevent them from becoming to large on bigger monitors. 


## Goals
My goals for prototyping and proof of concept are to fully flesh out every page within a wireframe and keep this simple but usable. I plan to create a little of every page when in the prototyping state to keep from getting to far down the line on one page and losing a cohesive design between each page. I feel when developing a few pages bit by bit they flow better then completing one and moving to the next. 

My MVP is to have many photos and a few charts that show members and those interested in the organization what we are and what we do.

Stretch Goals are to fully have a website that is able to have the ability to secure more interaction between the user than just reading the page and seeing amazing charts, information and photos. Another stretch goal is to use a library to create a calendar on the events page such as FullCalendar https://fullcalendar.io. Another stretch goal will be to add more than just the four pages add one for rush information and pledge information.
