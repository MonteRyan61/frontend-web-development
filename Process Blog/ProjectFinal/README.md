# Final Project, Process
## Milestone 1 Proposal

### Overall description of the project:

* The topic/purpose of the SPA
    * Cook Book Application
* Your inspiration for the SPA
    * As a college student I never know what to cook and get tired of searching random ad filled websites
    * I love food and am interested in making new things
    * This will be a great way to explore and learn React and the SPA element that comes with that
* The intended audience for your SPA
    * College Students interested in cooking different items.

### Wireframe that shows the design and flow of your team's project. This could be anywhere from hand drawn sequence of images to a low-fidelity mockup in a UX design tool of choice.
We utilized https://coolors.co to figure out a food based cook book vibe type of color pallete to begin. Since this is a group project we both wanted to be on the same page and thus made a prototype within figma rather than a paper sketch.

### Sources
Hover Effect on images: https://github.com/ciar4n/imagehover.css

I am sure we will find more along the way. We will definetly be using the React websites documentation.

### Personal Contributions
Plan to work and focus on the hover affect to begin. Then I really wanna get this involved with apis and possibly some back end to store some reveiws.

### Goals
* Prototyping/proof of concept
  * Prototyped out in figma to ensure we are both on the same page as far as the content we want on the site.
  * Selecting a appropriate color palate 
  * Researched some api's and hover affects
* MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
  * At Least 10 recipes to choose from and search from.
  * Hover effect on these as images in a gallery so that we are able to have the user hover and then see more. Then they would click to view the entire recipe.
  * Finding the recipes and displaying them in a unique fashion
* Stretch goals
  * Utilize an API to get access to even more recipes and have them rotate out and have recipe of the day
  * Utilize a database to store the user's review of a recipe they have tried.
  * Creating a search bar
  * New day, new recipe with the date displayed at the top right like a recipe of the day
