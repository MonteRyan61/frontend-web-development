# Final Project, Process
## Milestone 1 Proposal

### Overall description of the project:

* The topic/purpose of the SPA
    * Cook Book Application
* Your inspiration for the SPA
    * As a college student I never know what to cook and get tired of searching random ad filled websites
    * I love food and am interested in making new things
    * This will be a great way to explore and learn React and the SPA element that comes with that
* The intended audience for your SPA
    * College Students interested in cooking different items.

### Wireframe that shows the design and flow of your team's project. This could be anywhere from hand drawn sequence of images to a low-fidelity mockup in a UX design tool of choice.
We utilized https://coolors.co to figure out a food based cook book vibe type of color pallete to begin. Since this is a group project we both wanted to be on the same page and thus made a prototype within figma rather than a paper sketch.

### Sources
Hover Effect on images: https://github.com/ciar4n/imagehover.css

I am sure we will find more along the way. We will definetly be using the React websites documentation.

### Personal Contributions
Plan to work and focus on the hover affect to begin. Then I really wanna get this involved with apis and possibly some back end to store some reveiws.

### Goals
* Prototyping/proof of concept
  * Prototyped out in figma to ensure we are both on the same page as far as the content we want on the site.
  * Selecting a appropriate color palate 
  * Researched some api's and hover affects
* MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
  * At Least 10 recipes to choose from and search from.
  * Hover effect on these as images in a gallery so that we are able to have the user hover and then see more. Then they would click to view the entire recipe.
  * Finding the recipes and displaying them in a unique fashion
* Stretch goals
  * Utilize an API to get access to even more recipes and have them rotate out and have recipe of the day
  * Utilize a database to store the user's review of a recipe they have tried.
  * Creating a search bar
  * New day, new recipe with the date displayed at the top right like a recipe of the day



## Milestone 2 WIP
Overall after beginning this project it has become apparent how much more planning and preparation is needed when creating a React based SPA. I have been able to come up with and implement certain components up to this point. I have mainly focused on what will be static such as the title and the search bar. Getting the search bar to work in react took some adjusting from when it was in normal js. I will be adjusting the first idea to get this search bar implemented in a way that allows us to highlight or bring attenttion to one of the recipes. Even though that was a stretch goal to begin with I find that the site needs this as a MVP so that will be implemented.

I have begun to add just a list of recipes but also began to look into an api to populate this list. Most seem to have to be paid for so that may be out of the plan and just create a list with our top 10 favorite recipes.

Shown above is what I have experimented with thus far and will work on the styling, animation, state for the full recipe and image inclusion. But for now I am getting content loaded in and decided what needs to be state and what needs to be a seperate component. We are finding that it is hard to develop with multiple people as there are so many different ways of implementing and utilizing components. We will work to solve this by getting a good plan set in class! After further collaboration we have our components planned out and found an api that may work but for now we will continue to use static recipes to get the flow down and see if we have a way to implement the api late. I found a cool way of storing the data that could be adapted into using an api! Now with all of that on the way I plan to work on getting a hover effect to work in react using event listeners.
